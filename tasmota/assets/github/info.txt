1. A configuration window will open ![window](../assets/images/docs/window.png =150x*)
2. Fill in the fields (the IP range is mandatory so that the plugin can search for your connected devices on your network).
3. If your Sonoff modules require a login and password, enter them in the authentication section as well.
4. The plugin will then scan for modules present on the network, and you will find them in Widget Studio.
